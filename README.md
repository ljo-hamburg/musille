If you are usure how to install the theme see [this help page](https://wordpress.org/support/article/using-themes/#adding-new-themes) for more information.

The theme supports auto update functionality via [Plugin Update Checker](https://github.com/YahnisElsts/plugin-update-checker). This functionality is enabled by default.

## Comments

The Musille theme **does not support comments**. Although it does nothing to prevent wordpress from using comment functionality, neither comments nor a comment form are included in the theme at the moment.

It is recommended that you use a plugin such as [Disable Comments](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-comments/) to completely hide the comments functionality from your site.
